👋 Hello there! I'm currently a second-year Bachelor's student in Computer Science, deeply fascinated by the world of software development, clouds, and low-level programming. My journey began with a strong foundation in discrete mathematics which I'm eager to apply to building a wide range of software applications.

🔍 Exploring the World of Software: I'm continuously exploring various aspects of software development, from high-level languages to low-level optimizations, seeking to deepen my understanding and expand my skill set.

🎓 Educational Background: I've completed 2.5 years of study at the University of Nuclear Energy in Sevastopol(UA). Unfortunately, due to political events, I had to relocate, but my passion for learning and creating remains undiminished.

💡 Areas of Strength: I have a solid grasp of discrete mathematics, providing me with a strong analytical foundation for problem-solving in software development.

🚀 Areas for Growth: While I'm enthusiastic about learning and open to contributing to various projects, I recognize that there are areas where I'm looking to improve. Specifically, I'm focusing on enhancing my knowledge and proficiency in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, CI/CD, Golang, and C++.

🤝 Open to Collaboration: I'm eager to collaborate with others on projects, share knowledge, and contribute to the vibrant community of developers. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss exciting projects!

🌱 Continuous Learning: Every day, I strive to learn something new and deepen my understanding of software development principles, techniques, and tools. I believe in the importance of lifelong learning and embracing new challenges.

📫 Get in Touch: If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach me out to via email.
