### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm at the second year of my Bachelor in CS.

Only started my way into software development. Pretty much fascinated with everything regarding software development, clouds, reverse engineering, low-level programming etc.

I have a strong knowledge of discrete math. I aspire to implement all this knowledge in the ability to build every software I want.

Opened to contribution and collaborating on everthing, and comprehending new things daily!!! 

P.S:
I've got 2.5 years at the University of Nuclear Energy in Sevastopol(UA). However, I was forced to leave my hometown, because of political events, that happen sometimes.
