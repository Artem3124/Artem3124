### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm at the second year of my Bachelor in CS.

Only started my way into software development. Pretty much fascinated with everything regarding software development, clouds, low-level programming etc.

I have a strong knowledge of discrete math. I aspire to implement all this knowledge in the ability to build every software I want.

Opened to contribution and collaborating on everything, and comprehending new things daily!!! 

P.S:
I've got 2.5 years at the University of Nuclear Energy in Sevastopol(UA). However, I was forced to leave my hometown, because of political events, that happen sometimes.
